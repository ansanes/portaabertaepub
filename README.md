# Porta Aberta EPUB

This is an exmaple ePub 3 publication. 

This project is an example to demonstate the usage of advanced accesibility features in epub publications.

This epub is used in the learn my way application which can be found here: https://github.com/ansanes/learnmywayreader.

### Generating the epub file

The project includes a gulp file (gulpfile.js) that can be used to package all the assets into an .epub file.

If you want to use the epub in conjunction with the android learn my way epplication App you can modify the value of the outputPath so that it point to the correct location in your Android Studio Project where the .epub file will be copied to after being generated.
