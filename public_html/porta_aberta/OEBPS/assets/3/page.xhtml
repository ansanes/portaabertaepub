Two children, a boy and girl are sitting down around the table while a man, their father, serves them delicious food grown on the farm. A woman, their mother, is walking over to the table from inside the house with a plate of hot roast chicken. There are chickens, a rooster, chicks, ducks, dogs, birds and a cat in the garden around them. There are potted plants around the house and bees buzzing around. There is a parrot perched near the door to the house and a turkey in the yard. Behind the garden, there is a field of corn, and two cows grazing on grass near a gentle river. Behind the river there a trees and hills leading into the distance below a red and blue sky. END IMAGE" />
